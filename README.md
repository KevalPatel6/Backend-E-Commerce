# Backend-E-Commerce   [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This is a repository for an application that builds the back end for an e-commerce site. Given some starter code, the application's backend was completed using Express.js, which allowed us to use Sequelize in order to interact with a MySQL database. The application was created in order to allow managers of internet retail companies to have a competing backend service that will create a database for all their inventory and dynamically update it based on transactions on the front end. It solves the problem of giving the user on the front end information about the retail companies inventory, products, prices, and categories. This provides the user with updated information regarding the retailers goods. As a software developer, I was able to create a backend service and understand how to connect to a database right from my javascript code using Sequelize. Additionally, I was able to work on the backend services using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods and testing them using Insomnia.  

## Usage

In order to use this backend application, you will need to download all the files in the repository and place them within a single directory. Once in a directory, you will need to connect to a MySQL database where you can run the schema under the db folder. Next, you will need to npm install all the dependencies that you see in the package.json. From there, you will need to run the seeds by using the syntax 'npm run seed', which will populate your database. Finally, you can run the server using Node.js by using the command 'node server.js' from the integrated terminal. Make sure you are in the correct folder in the command line before completing any of the steps above. From here, you can test all your end points.
